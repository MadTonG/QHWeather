<h1 id="qhweather">QHWeather</h1>
<p>Have you ever wanted current weather information on your computer or laptop as easily as you can get it on your phone? Me too.</p>
<p>I wanted a program that provided all the weather information I needed without having to open a web browser, dig through my bookmarks, or spend time scrolling down web pages looking for links. I wanted access to forecasts, watches, warnings, radars, and discussions. I wanted a program that could provide me with that information in a compressed, easy to understand format. I wanted weather radars -- both national and local -- one button click away. I wanted to be able to look at other weather radars around the state or country without having to do separate Internet searches for each one. And finally, I wanted a program that would have adjustable fonts so that I could see the information without having to squint or strain my eyes.</p>
<p>That is why I made QHWeather.</p>
<h1 id="is-qhweather-complete">Is QHWeather complete?</h1>
<p>Yes and no. It is fully functional and complete enough that I wouldn't be embarrassed if it were to go viral. That being said, I have no doubt that there are still a few bugs to find.</p>
<h1 id="what-operating-system-is-required-for-qhweather">What operating system is required for QHWeather?</h1>
<p>QHWeather was written using the Qt development environment and libraries to make it compatible with as many systems as possible. The binaries provided should run on any modern version of <strong>Windows</strong> operating system from Windows 7 through Windows 10. The source code should be capable of being compiled on most distributions of <strong>Linux</strong> as well as on the <strong>Mac</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-i-install-qhweather-the-binaries-on-windows">How do I install QHWeather (the binaries) on Windows?</h1>
<p>As of now, there isn't an installer. QHWeather only comes in a portable version.</p>

</ol>
<h1 id="how-do-i-get-rid-of-qhweather-on-windows">How do I get rid of QHWeather on Windows?</h1>
<p>QHWeather doesn't write to any place other than the directory that it was installed in. To get rid of QHWeather, simply delete the directory that it was unzipped to in the installation process.</p>
<h1 id="where-do-i-provide-feedback">Where do I provide feedback?</h1>

<p>Not only am I interested in hearing about any bugs that you find in the program, but also any feature requests or comments.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
